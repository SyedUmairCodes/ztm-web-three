# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
After the criticism regarding the proof of work technique a new technique called proof of stake is now being introduced in the blockchain world which makes blockchains more compelling.

In proof of stake you manually set aside some amount of bitcoin from your account and get selected randomly based on the amount of bitcoins you've set aside.

If you add an invalid block to the blockchain you will lose the amount of that you staked for mining.

This concept is better than proof of work because you don't need to have multiple computers running all the time to mine bitcoin for you. In proof of stake people that add new blocks to the blockchain are called validators and not miners and this way to add new blocks is better than the proof of work way.

The winner between these two ways to add new blocks is not decided yet because both have their own pros and cons.
