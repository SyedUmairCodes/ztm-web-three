# IPFS
The IPFS or Inter-planetary file system is a distributed file system like blockchains. IPFS uses a peer-to-peer system and uses unique hashes like blockchains for file validation.

IPFS is used to user data in DApps. The data that a user enters into the frontend of the DApp to access the smart contract assigned to it is stored in the IPFS.

If you create a social-network on a block-chain to login details of a users account cannot be stored inside the smart contract or the front-end and that's where IPFS is used to store these types of data.
