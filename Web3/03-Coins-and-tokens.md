# Coins and Tokens
A crypto currency can exist in the form of coins like bitcoin or tokens like thether.

Coins are native to the block-chain that they are created on. Ethereum has a native coin called ether(ETH) and there are many tokens that third-party developers have created on the Ethereum block-chain like tether.

Crypto currencies can also be classified by if they are used for transactions or stored for their value. Bitcoin was originally invented to be used like gold and it's value would grow over time.

Transaction crypto currencies like ripple are used for small transactions because the transaction fee on these block-chains is minimal as that of compared to the Ethereum block-chain. The transaction fee is also called gas in the Ethereum block-chain.

You can further distribute crypto currencies by their ability to be mine able or not.

- Mineable crypto currencies like bitcoin allow users to take ownership of some bitcoins if they contribute to a new node on the block-chain.
- A non- mineable crypto currency is when all of the tokens or coins available on the block-chain is already available to the creator from the start and only they can distribute the coins or tokens to other people.
