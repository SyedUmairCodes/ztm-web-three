# Crypto currencies
Crypto currencies are digital currency that any person in the world can use. Normal currency like dollars and yen require a central governing body that regulates these currencies. The governing body applies rules and regulations to these currencies which everyone has to follow.

Since normal currencies are printed on paper and coins they can't be transferred digitally unless you use a third-party service which also takes a minimal service fee for transferring your money.

Crypto currencies on the other don't have any central governing body instead they rely on the rules of the block-chain they are used on. Crypto currencies don't exist on paper they are all digital and that's why we don't need a third-party service to send and receive them.

Just like normal currency, there are many types of crypto currencies available today that have a total market cap of more than that of a country's GDP.

The two most popular crypto currencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum and most other crypto currencies are just copies of these two with more or less features.

## Rules and regulations
Currencies are inflatable. Meaning, the more money the government prints out the more existing money loses it's value. The government can increase and decrease the value of their currencies according to their needs.

Crypto currencies are some what free from inflation because they aren't controlled by a single entity that can increase and decrease their value. In fact some crypto currencies are designed to increase their value by decreasing the amount of the total currency that can be mined.
