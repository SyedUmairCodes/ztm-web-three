# The UTXO Set
A block-chain is a distributed ledger in its simplest form. A blockchain is a convenient and transparent way to keep track of transactions that happen regarding different types of crypto currencies. Each block in a block-chain is a record of a transaction made on that block-chain.

A block-chain is a perfect example of an distributed ledger. Each block in the blockchain only stores the amount of money that was transferred or received. It doesn't keep track of the total amount of money a person has.

The program that allows us to compute the ledger and everyone's balance in bitcoin is called the unspent transaction output set or the UTXO for short. The UTXO is an extra set of data that lives alongside the block-chain and tells us that who own what at the current moment.

Ethereum uses a different approach. Ethereum uses a state database. This database is similar to the UTXO set but is more simpler and flexible but doesn't provide that much privacy as much as the UTXO set.
