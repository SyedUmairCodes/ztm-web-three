# Use cases and upgrades

## Blockchain in Healthcare
Block-chain technology can be a great asset in the world of health care. We can decentralize the health records of patients that are admitted in an hospital or all of the hospitals in the country. 

This allows your records to be available to every doctor that you visit and then the doctor can help you more effectively because he'll have an understanding of your previous health conditions.

A person also has privacy and regulations regarding his health records and should be encrypted and only be accessible to you and your doctor and also the doctor that *You* allow to see them.

## Upgrading the Blockchain
A block-chain is a database of transactions that is distributed to every single person  that makes a transaction and since every person has his own copy a consensus is used to make sure that all members have the exact same data. 

If someone wanted to take the current state of the blockchain and add or remove features from it and transform into his own version he needs to create a fork of the blockchain.

There are two types of forks a person can make, A soft fork or a hard fork:

- A soft fork is an upgrade is backwards compatible. Meaning that the older version of the blockchain can recognize the new update and the newer version can work seamlessly with the old one. Sometimes the developers will focus on only the new version and only offer limited support for the old version and will request users to migrate to the newer version
- A hard fork is an upgrade that introduces completely new changes that are not backwards compatible and the only option to keep using the software is to upgrade to the newer version because the changes are so different that they cannot be compatible with the older version.
