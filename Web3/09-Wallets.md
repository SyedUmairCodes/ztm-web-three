# Wallets and Addresses
Using multiple addresses for performing transactions in crypto currencies is a common practice.

A single crypto wallet can have multiple addresses and each address can contain small amounts of bitcoin that add up together the total amount of bitcoin you have.

A crypto wallet is like a bank and the addresses are like bank accounts. The developers behind bitcoin encourage users to use a different address each time they make a transaction on the bitcoin block-chain.

This process of having multiple addresses keeps the users details private and also makes the transactions public.
