# Types of NFTs

## Fungible Vs Non-fungible
A fungible token or asset is equal to 1:1. A single US dollar is only equal to another US dollar regardless of when it was printed or it's serial number. If the asset can be changed in value and in likeness it is considered fungible. Bitcoin also is an example of a fungible token or asset.

> Examples of non-fungible tokens can be a plane ticket, a watch, and a collection of stamps or figurines.

A Rolex watch is sometime worth millions of dollars no matter how old it is.(Sometimes the older ones cost more.) And a regular watch that you buy from a local store is worth only it's price and it's value will only decrease and not increase as time goes by like the

Rolex. The serial code and model of the Rolex also matters because the more unique the watch will be the more valuable it will be.

Two Rolex watches of the same model, one made in 1950 and one made in 2020 have different values because the older model has a higher value that the community of watch collectors have given it. The value of the asset determines that is it a fungible asset or a non-fungible asset.

# Features of NFTs

## Interoperable
NFTs have the ability to be exchanged across eco-systems. The actual NFT is just a token. If that token is created on the ethereum block-chain it can be exchanged on any block-chain that is based on the ethereum block-chain and marketplaces.

## Immutable
An NFT should be unique and in-divisible. An asset can have multiple copies of it on the block-chain but each individual unit has a unique serial number or code that makes it different from others.

They make look the same but in reality they are all unique. Block-chains records data in a way that makes it very hard for us to change it.

## Trading
An NFT can be freely traded on any compatible marketplace or block-chain. An NFT can be traded across ecosystems, for example if I have an asset on the ethereum blockchain and want to trade it for another asset on a block-chain that is compatible with ethereum I can easily trade it.

## Liquidity
Liquidity means that I can sell my NFTs on marketplaces that will give me cash or bitcoin or ethereum instead of another digital asset of the same value.

## Program-ability
NFTs also need to support the ability to hold code inside of them. We can program NFTs that will allow us to execute certain tasks at a certain period of time.

# NFT Standards

## ERC-721
ERC-721 is the first standard for NFTs on ethereum. Its like a template for building smart contracts on the ethereum network. It provides all of the guidelines that you need to create your NFTs. This standard creates and keeps track of ownership of NFTs.

## ERC-1155
The last standard on the ethereum network is called ERC-1155. This standard is like an enhancement to the ERC-721 standard.

ERC-1155 is an super-set of the ERC-721 standard because it can hold classes and is a lot cheaper. You can also trade in bulk and also create ERC-721 tokens in an ERC-1155 token.
